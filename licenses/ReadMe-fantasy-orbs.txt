Title: Fantasy Orb Brushes For GIMP
Date: October 20, 2011
Created By: LoneRoyalButterfly

These brushes have been tested with GIMP version 2.6.11

There is 1 brush in 8 different colors in 2 sizes, plus 2 brush pipes (brushes that change colors), making a total of 18 brushes.

Enjoy the brushes, and you can use and distribute them in whatever way you like as long as you do not claim them as yours (giving credit is not mandatory, just don't go around telling people you made the brushes)
